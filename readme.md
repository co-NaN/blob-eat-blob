A simple game (very) loosely based on Katamari Damacy I built for practicing JavaScript modularization, using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and Webpack.

To try, make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then:

1. `npm install webpack --save-dev`

2. navigate to the project folder

3. `npm run build`
